# Godot TODO 4

Keep your **ideas** and **notes** of your Godot projects!

## What?

With this *Godot engine* plugin, you are able to write ideas and notes for tracking your project status.
Once this plugin installed, a new dock **Notes** appears on the rightside docks bar with an input textbox.
The notes are stored per projects inside the subfolder *notes* of the plugin folder.
Example: *your_project/addons/todo_4/notes/example.txt*
The plugin currently supports the following extensions: txt, md, cfg, ini, log, json, yml, yaml, and toml.
But automatic formatting or checking is not provided.

## Where?

To install this plugin, copy the **addons** folder in your project root.
Final result : *your_project/addons/todo_4/*

## Thanks =)
